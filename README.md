## Procedural Generation Test

Creates a cave system from cellular automata and/or blasting rooms into the walls. Currently using multi-threaded GDscript, really work is done a separate worker thread. Could possibly split some sections into more workers/threads.

# Milestone TODOs:

* Improve connecting rooms to run quicker. See SL's cave gen YT videos
* Disable relevant UI elements during "work"
* Move generator parameters to a separate object that the generator can copy during work for greater thread safety
* Move Generator out of the world script to a separate object, for greater reusability
* Possibly convert the generator to C# for speed boost.

# Possible targets for more threads

* The cellular automata section: The map could be divided into sections and run parallel, however this is not the slowest section
* Finding closest rooms: Each tuple of rooms could be split into another worker. Distances compared at the end
